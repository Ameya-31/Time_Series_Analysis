# Time_Series_Analysis
## Defining the problem
- We are comparing different models for analysis of time series data.
- We are checking the resulkts with the baseline of ARIMA model, which is considered as the best model for time series data.
- How should you define the train-test split ? We are defining the train-test-validation split by using the window slideing method where we first split the whole time seires into 3 sets & afterwards we perform our window sliding method to proivide for the input of our model like NN, decision tree & linear models
